                        <h2>Reiki Healing</h2>
                        <p class="lm-p-right-padding">Maybe you’ve heard of Reiki Healing but aren’t quite sure what it
                            is. Or, perhaps you have been considering Reiki treatments but aren’t sure if they’re right
                            for your needs. Or maybe a doctor suggested Reiki Healing to complement your current medical
                            treatments. Whatever the reason, Reiki Healing can be an incredibly powerful way to nurture
                            your mind and body.
                            Pronounced ray-kee, this traditional form of healing does not involve any manual muscle
                            manipulation. Mikao Usui developed this technique way back in the 1900s. He coined the term
                            using the Japanese words rei, which translates to “universal,” and ki, which is life force
                            energy that flows through every living organism. Today, Reiki Healing is used around the
                            world by doctors, nurses, and massage therapists in cityname.</p>
                        <p class="lm-p-right-padding">During a Reiki Healing session, the patient stretches out in a
                            relaxed position, in a quiet room with no disturbances. Healing energy is released to all
                            major organs through targeted hand positioning and sacred symbols. Deeply nurturing by
                            nature, this process often ends with the patient drifting off to sleep. Reiki healing is
                            helpful for a number of different reasons and helps alleviate stress while improving overall
                            wellness. According to studies, Reiki treatments help promote a feeling of security, peace,
                            and relaxation.</p>

                                myofascial, neuromuscular, and trigger point therapies. This massage uses gentle, yet
                                firm pressure across the body to ease muscle tension and promote relaxation. Sit back,
                                relax, and let Adriane slip into a calm state of relaxation as she works her magic on
                                your tendons and muscles.</p>

                            <p>Studies have shown that hormone levels associated with stress and relaxation are greatly
                                affected when massage therapy is used during prenatal care. This kind of massage leads

                            <p>The swelling of the joints during pregnancy, also called Edema, is usually caused by a
                                lack of circulation and pressure on the blood vessels. Pregnancy massages help to reduce
                                the amount of fluid in swollen joints while stimulating soft tissue.</p>

                            <p>Many women experience sciatic nerve pain late in pregnancy as the uterus rests on muscles
                                of the pelvic floor. This pressure spreads tension to the muscles of the lower and upper
                                legs, causing them to swell and affect nearby nerves. Massage therapy eases the inflamed
                                nerves by releasing tension on nearby muscles.</p>

                        <p>CBD massage treatments involve infusing full-spectrum CBD oil in massage gel or lotion before
                            applying the infusion to a patient's skin. This infusion does not contain THC or any
                            components that may get the patient “high.” It does, however, promote deep relaxation and
                            tension release and is a great option for those with chronic pain issues.</p>
